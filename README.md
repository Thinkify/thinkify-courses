- ## Editor

  - ### VSCode

    Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is our current text editor of choice. It is lightweight and easily extendable. It is built and maintained by Microsoft so it has really good native TypeScript support and is updated every month.

    [Download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    Install the extensions from VSCode's extension marketplace. To make your vs code awesome.

- ## Version Managers

  - ### Node Version Manager

    Node Version Manager (nvm for short) is used for managing the different versions of node and npm installed on your machine. It allows you to easily switch between versions so that you can always make sure you are using the same version as everyone else for every project
    

    [Install nvm by following the instructions here.](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

- ## Package Managers

  - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

  - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)(along with [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b))
